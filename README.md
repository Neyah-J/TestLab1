# Apps and Services with .NET 7, First Edition

> .NET 7 reached its end-of-life on [Tuesday, May 14, 2024](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core#lifecycle). I recommend upgrading to [.NET 8](https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net8/blob/main/README.md) as soon as possible.

With every Packt book you get a DRM-free PDF version of that book at no cost. Submit your proof of purchase at the following link:

Available on Packt's website in eBook or Print + eBook editions, or included with a Packt Subscription from November 15, 2022. All of my books on Packt's website: https://subscription.packtpub.com/search?query=mark+j.+price

## Code solutions for Visual Studio 2022 and Visual Studio Code

If you have Visual Studio 2022 for Windows and Visual Studio Code and its C# extension installed on the same computer, the build process can sometimes conflict. This is because Visual Studio has its own non-standard build server that is different from the standard build server used by .NET SDK. Visual Studio 2022 and Visual Studio Code also use different file types to group projects. So I have duplicated and separated solution code for each product:

- [/vs4win](/vs4win): Visual Studio 2022 for Windows solution files and projects for each chapter
- [/vscode](/vscode): Visual Studio Code workspace files and projects for each chapter

## Microsoft Certifications
Announcing the New Foundational C# Certification with freeCodeCamp:
https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-foundational-csharp-certification/

Microsoft used to have professional exams and certifications for developers that covered skills like C# and ASP.NET. Sadly, they have retired them all. These days, the only developer-adjacent exams and certifications are for Azure or Power Platform, as you can see from the certification poster: https://aka.ms/traincertposter
