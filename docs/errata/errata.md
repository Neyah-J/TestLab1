# Page 16 - Installing other extensions

In the table, the **C# for Visual Studio Code** extension says it is "powered by OmniSharp". This is true up to the most recent release version `1.25.9`. But if you install the pre-release version `2.0.x` then it does not include OmniSharp any more.

To follow the instructions in the book, if you have installed the pre-release version `2.0.x` then on the **C#** extension page, I recommend that you click the button **Switch to Release Version** to revert back to the current release version `1.25.9`.

The link to the SQL language reference is broken in the PDF version due to a line break. It should be:

## Category class changes

In Step 7, I show the class that represents a `Category` in the Northwind database that is generated by the `dotnet-ef`, as shown in the following code:
```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

namespace Northwind.Console.EFCore.Models
{
  [Index("CategoryName", Name = "CategoryName")]
  public partial class Category
  {
    public Category()
    {
      Products = new HashSet<Product>();
    }

    [Key]
    public int CategoryId { get; set; }

    [StringLength(15)]
    public string CategoryName { get; set; } = null!;

    [Column(TypeName = "ntext")]
    public string? Description { get; set; }

    [Column(TypeName = "image")]
    public byte[]? Picture { get; set; }

    [InverseProperty("Category")]
    public virtual ICollection<Product> Products { get; set; }
  }
}
```
The current `dotnet-ef` tool generates slightly different output, for example, it uses a file-scoped namespace declaration to avoid indenting and it initializes the `Products` property to a `List<T>` instead of a `HashSet<T>`, as shown in the following code:
```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

namespace Northwind.Console.EFCore.Models;

[Index("CategoryName", Name = "CategoryName")]
public partial class Category
{
  [Key]
  public int CategoryId { get; set; }

  [StringLength(15)]
  public string CategoryName { get; set; } = null!;

  [Column(TypeName = "ntext")]
  public string? Description { get; set; }

  [Column(TypeName = "image")]
  public byte[]? Picture { get; set; }

  [InverseProperty("Category")]
  public virtual ICollection<Product> Products { get; } = new List<Product>();
}
```

## NorthwindDb class changes

In Step 9, I show the class that represents the Northwind database that was generated by the `dotnet-ef` tool. The current `dotnet-ef` tool generates slightly different output, for example, it uses a file-scoped namespace declaration to avoid indenting and it does not set each `DbSet<T>` property to the null-forgiving operator, as shown in the following code:
```cs
// older version of dotnet-ef did this:
public virtual DbSet<Category> Categories { get; set; } = null!;

// current version of dotnet-ef does this:
public virtual DbSet<Category> Categories { get; set; }
```

We asked the compiler to treat warnings as errors so we cannot build until the compiler knows that all those 25+ properties are safe to use as `null`. We could manually add the null-forgiving operator, or use a find and replace regular expression to do it, or customize the T4 template used by the `dotnet-ef` tool to set all `DbSet<T>` properties to the null-forgiving operator, but the easiest thing to do is simply disable null warnings for this file by adding the following statement to the top of the class file, as shown in the following code:
```cs
#nullable disable
```

Microsoft recommends either setting `DbSet<T>` properties to the null-forgiving operator, or calling the `Set<T>` method defined in the `DbContext` base class to implement them as a read-only property, as shown in the following code:
```cs
public virtual DbSet<Category> Categories => Set<Category>();
```

> Thanks to [charlygg](https://github.com/charlygg) for suggesting using the `Set<T>` method in a comment on [issue on 1 January 2023](https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net7/issues/5#issuecomment-1368614033).

# Page 102 - Creating a class library for the data context using SQL Server

In Step 1, I wrote, "In Visual Studio Code, select `Northwind.Common.DataContext.SqlServer` as the active OmniSharp project." 

This works if you installed the most recent release version `1.25.9`. But if you installed the pre-release version `2.0.x` then it does not include OmniSharp any more.

To follow the instructions in the book, if you have installed the pre-release version `2.0.x` then on the **C#** extension page, I recommend that you click the button **Switch to Release Version** to revert back to the current release version `1.25.9`.

# Page 200 - Testing an AutoMapper configuration

> Thanks to Doug Murphy for raising this issue via email.

In the note at the top of page 200, I wrote, "For the entity models, we used records because they will be immutable. But an 
instance of `Summary` will be created and then its members populated automatically by AutoMapper, so it must be a normal mutable class with public properties that can be set."

But records are not always immutable. They are immutable in this scenario due to the way I defined them. It is possible to define mutable records. For example:
```cs
// As defined in the book. This will not work because it // only has a 
// constructor with two parameters. AutoMapper needs to call a default 
// constructor (no parameters) and then set the properties.
public record Summary(string? FullName, decimal Total);

// This works because it has a default constructor and due to the init 
// keywords. After constructing an instance, the properties can be set,
// but after that, the properties cannot be changed.
public record Summary 
{
  public string? FullName { get; init; }
  public decimal Total { get; init; }
}
```

In the next edition, I will use the `init` style to define the `Summary` record.

# Page 417 - Understanding Strawberry Shake - Creating a console app client

In Step 4, you add references to two StrawberryShake packages. I had hoped that version 13 would be released by now, but it is still in preview for one of those packages and is not available at all for the other. I therefore recommend that you use version 12.16.0, as shown in the following markup:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection" Version="7.0.0" />
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Http" Version="7.0.0" />
  <PackageReference Include="StrawberryShake.CodeGeneration.CSharp.Analyzers" Version="12.16.0" />
  <PackageReference Include="StrawberryShake.Transport.Http" Version="12.16.0" />
</ItemGroup>
```

> ChilliCream recommends that you always use the same versions when referencing multiple of their packages to ensure they work together properly.

In Step 9, you add a file named `seafoodProducts.graphql`. After creating this file, review the project file to check for an entry to explicitly remove this file from the build process, as shown in the following markup: 
```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <GraphQL Remove="seafoodProducts.graphql" />
</ItemGroup>
```

There must be at least one .graphql file for the Strawberry Shake tool to be able to generate its code automatically. So this entry will prevent the Strawberry Shake tool from generating its code and you will later get compile errors. You should delete or comment out that entry, as shown in the following markup:
```xml
<!--<ItemGroup>
  <GraphQL Remove="seafoodProducts.graphql" />
</ItemGroup>-->
```

# Page 467 - Adding a chat page to the MVC website

In Step 2, in a JavaScript file named `chat.js`, I tell the reader to add statements to add events handlers for the **Register** and **Send** buttons, and so on. One of those statements uses a backtick \` to enable JavaScript interpolated strings that use curly brackets `{}` for dynamic placeholders. 

But after submitting final drafts in a Word document, a Packt process replaced the backtick characters with single straight quote `'` characters. This disabled the interpolated strings. I had even added a comment to explain to the reader that they should use a backtick character but the Packt process replaced that too! 

Incorrect code in the print book in the comment and string value:
```cs
// note the use of backtick ' to enable a formatted string
li.textContent =
  'To ${received.to}, From ${received.from}: ${received.body}';
```

The statement should be as follows:

```cs
// note the use of backtick ` to enable a formatted string
li.textContent =
  `To ${received.to}, From ${received.from}: ${received.body}`;
```

Luckily, the code was correct in the GitHub repository:
https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net7/blob/main/vs4win/Chapter13/Northwind.SignalR.Service.Client.Mvc/wwwroot/js/chat.js#L28

# Page 571 - Blazor routing to page components

`MainLayout.cshtml` should be `MainLayout.razor`.

> Thanks to [Bob Molloy](https://github.com/BobMolloy) for raising this [issue on 8 February 2023](https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net7/issues/9).

In Step 3, the filename `_Imports.cshtml` should be `_Imports.razor`.

# Page 600 - Building a local storage service

In Step 9, the filename `_Imports.cshtml` should be `_Imports.razor`.

# Page 613 - Exploring Radzen Blazor components

> Thanks to [Bob Molloy](https://github.com/BobMolloy) for raising this [issue on 14 March 2023](https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net7/issues/11).

In Step 10, the filename `_Imports.cshtml` should be `_Imports.razor`. Also, the text should say, "add statements to import the Radzen and Radzen Blazor namespaces", not just one statement.

> Thanks to [Bob Molloy](https://github.com/BobMolloy) for raising this [issue on 14 March 2023](https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net7/issues/12).

In Step 6, the statement to include the products is missing a close bracket. It should be as shown:
```cs
app.MapGet("api/categories", (
  [FromServices] NorthwindContext db) => 
    Results.Json(
      db.Categories.Include(c => c.Products)))
  .WithName("GetCategories")
  .Produces<Category[]>(StatusCodes.Status200OK);
```

The GitHub repository code solution used a slightly older version of this code. It has now been updated to match the book, as shown at the following link:
https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net7/blob/main/vs4win/Chapter17/Northwind.BlazorLibraries/Server/Program.cs#L44

> Thanks to [Bob Molloy](https://github.com/BobMolloy) for raising this [issue on 15 March 2023](https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net7/issues/13).

In Step 5, `MainLayout.cshtml` should be `MainLayout.razor`.

# Page 627 - Using the Radzen HTML editor component

In Step 3, `MainLayout.cshtml` should be `MainLayout.razor`.

# Page 631 - Using the Radzen chart component

In Step 5, `MainLayout.cshtml` should be `MainLayout.razor`.

# Page 633 - Using the Radzen form components

In Step 1, the statement to define and endpoint for employees manually sets JSON options, as shown in the following code:
```cs
app.MapGet("api/employees/", (
  [FromServices] NorthwindContext db) =>
    Results.Json(db.Employees, jsonOptions))
  .WithName("GetEmployees")
  .Produces<Employee[]>(StatusCodes.Status200OK);
```

It should use the globally configure JSON options, as shown in the following code:
```cs
app.MapGet("api/employees/", (
  [FromServices] NorthwindContext db) =>
    Results.Json(db.Employees))
  .WithName("GetEmployees")
  .Produces<Employee[]>(StatusCodes.Status200OK);
```

# Page 634 - Using the Radzen form components

In Step 2, `MainLayout.cshtml` should be `MainLayout.razor`.

> Thanks to [Bob Molloy](https://github.com/BobMolloy) for raising this [issue on 29 March 2023](https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net7/issues/15).

In Step 5, **Save** should be **Create**. Also in *Figure 18.2*, the caption of the button should be **Create** instead of **Save**. (I must have edited an existing device instead of creating a new one when taking the screenshot which caused this mistake.)
