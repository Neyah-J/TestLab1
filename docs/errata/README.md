# Errata and Improvements

If you find any mistakes in the first edition, *Apps and Services with .NET 7*, or if you have suggestions for improvements, then please [raise an issue in this repository](https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net7/issues) or email me at markjprice (at) gmail.com.

[**Errata** (29 items)](errata.md): Typos, tool user interface and behavior changes, or mistakes in code that would cause a compilation error that prevents a successful build.

[**Improvements** (10 items)](improvements.md): Changes to text or code that would improve the content. These are optional.

All errata and improvements will be included in the 2nd edition planned for publishing in November 2023. To be included they must be submitted by mid-September 2023.
